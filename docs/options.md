# Use the `PublicAPI.Shipped.txt` file generated by Unity Integration for the API dictionary.
# In many cases, it works faster than reflection mode because it can directly understand C# (.NET) signatures.
udon_analyzer.dictionary_mode = direct

# Use the DLL shipped with VRChat SDK directly for the API dictionary.
# This has the potential to degrade performance when running in parallel.
udon_analyzer.dictionary_mode = reflection

# Use the internal API list (In many cases, you will need to update the Analyzer at the same time you update the VRChat SDK).
# This is used if you cannot access to the VRChat SDK for some reason.
udon_analyzer.dictionary_mode = internal

# If set to True, the Analyzer will run only for UdonSharpBehaviour inherited classes, otherwise; it will run for all classes.
udon_analyzer.require_inherit = true
